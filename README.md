M2R
===

This project implements a bridge between the M language and the R language.

M is a powerful platform for managing healthcare information, and it is
commonly used to implement Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems.


R is a de-facto standard language for performing statistical analysis.

This bridge between M and R facilitates clinical research by making very easy
to query data stored in a MUMPS database and pass it to R scripts for
performing statistical analysis.
